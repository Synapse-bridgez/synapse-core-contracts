//! # Admin
//!
//! Role-based access control helpers.  The contract has two privileged roles:
//!
//! | Role          | Storage key       | Capabilities                              |
//! |---------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
//! | `admin`       | `StorageKey::Admin`       | Propose/accept admin transfer, rotate relay signer, pause/unpause, upgrade; also permitted to drive status transitions |
//! | `relay_signer`| `StorageKey::RelaySigner` | Register callbacks, drive status transitions |
//!
//! Both roles are initialised once and can be rotated by the admin.

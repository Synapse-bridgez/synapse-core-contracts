# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
as exposed by `SynapseCoreContract::version()`.

**Subscriber teams (Phase 2 / Phase 3):** prefer the
[Event schema](#event-schema) section when diffing releases — it is maintained
separately from general code changes. Full topic/field contracts live in
[`EVENTS.md`](./EVENTS.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Event schema

- Added `EventRelaySignerRotated` (topic `relay`), emitted by
  `set_relay_signer`. Additive new event per
  [`EVENTS.md` § Semver policy](./EVENTS.md#5-semver-policy) — Minor bump.
- Added `EventAdminTransferProposed` (topic `propose`), emitted by the new
  `propose_admin`. Additive new event — Minor bump.
- **Breaking:** `EventAdminTransferred` (topic `admin`) is now emitted by
  `accept_admin` instead of the removed `transfer_admin`. The event's own
  topic/fields/order are unchanged, but which entry-point triggers it — and
  how many calls that takes — has changed; per
  [`EVENTS.md` § Semver policy](./EVENTS.md#5-semver-policy) this is a
  **Major** change. Subscriber teams: expect `admin` no longer immediately
  after a single admin-initiated call — it now follows a separate
  `accept_admin` call from the nominee, which may arrive in a later ledger
  or not at all if never accepted.
- `EventContractUpgraded` gains an additive trailing `schema_version` field
  — Minor bump per the same policy.

### Added

- `EventRelaySignerRotated` — relay-signer rotation is now observable
  on-chain the same way admin transfer already is (see
  [`EVENTS.md`](./EVENTS.md#eventrelaysignerrotated)).
- `admin()` / `relay_signer()` read-only query entry points. Every other
  piece of contract state readable off-chain already had a query method;
  these two let deployment tooling and monitoring verify the on-chain role
  addresses against `contract-ids.json` instead of trusting that record
  alone. See `DEPLOYMENT.md`'s post-deployment smoke test.
- `schema_version()` / `pending_admin()` read-only query entry points.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `transfer_admin(new_admin)` is replaced by
  `propose_admin(new_admin)` + `accept_admin(caller)`. A single call from
  the current admin can no longer finalise a transfer on its own — the
  nominee must call `accept_admin` itself, proving key control via its own
  auth. Fixes THREAT_MODEL.md finding F-03. Integrators calling
  `transfer_admin` directly (not through this repo's SDK client) must
  switch to the two-step flow.
- **Breaking:** `upgrade(new_wasm_hash)` is now
  `upgrade(new_wasm_hash, expected_schema_version)`. The extra argument must
  match the on-chain `schema_version()` or the call is rejected with
  `SchemaVersionMismatch` before contract WASM is touched. Fixes
  THREAT_MODEL.md finding F-04.

### Fixed

- **Security:** `propose_admin` rejects nominating the contract's own
  address, which could not practically call `accept_admin` back and would
  have permanently bricked every admin-gated operation. Fixes
  THREAT_MODEL.md finding F-02 (Medium severity). Soroban has no "zero
  address" sentinel to check a nominee against generally — the contract's
  own address is the only "invalid address" this can detect on-chain.

- **Security:** `register_callback` no longer overwrites an existing
  transaction record on a late replay. Previously, once the ~24h idempotency
  key TTL expired, a replay with a different `idempotency_key` but the same
  `transaction_id` would silently reset a `Completed`/`Failed` transaction
  back to `Pending` and wipe its `stellar_tx_hash`/`failure_reason`. Fixes
  THREAT_MODEL.md finding F-07 (High severity). `register_callback` now
  returns `DuplicateRequest` for any `transaction_id` that already has a
  stored record, independent of idempotency-key state. Callers that relied
  on the old (buggy) re-registration behavior will now get an error instead.
- `complete_transaction` / `fail_transaction` now enforce the `stellar_tx_hash`
  (72 B) and `failure_reason` (64 B) length caps documented in
  [`COST_MODEL.md` §6](./COST_MODEL.md#6-string-length-cap-impact-enforced).
  The validators existed but were never wired into the handlers, so an
  oversized value from a compromised or buggy relay could bypass the
  documented rent-cost protection.
- `EVENTS.md` listed `EventStatusChanged`, `EventTransactionCompleted`,
  `EventTransactionFailed`, and `EventAdminTransferred` as "Locked schema
  (emitter scaffold)". All four have been wired into `src/lib.rs` and covered
  by tests since before this release; the doc now says **Live** to match.
  Document-only correction — no behaviour change, no version bump per
  [`EVENTS.md` § Semver policy](./EVENTS.md#5-semver-policy).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-22

### Event schema

Initial lock of the public event API (see [`EVENTS.md`](./EVENTS.md)).

| Topic[1] | Struct | Entry-point(s) | Notes |
|----------|--------|----------------|--------|
| `init` | `EventInitialised` | `initialize` | Live |
| `reg` | `EventTransactionRegistered` | `register_callback` | Live; omitted on idempotent replay |
| `pause` | `EventPauseToggled` | `pause`, `unpause` | Live |
| `upgrade` | `EventContractUpgraded` | `upgrade` | Live |
| `status` | `EventStatusChanged` | lifecycle transitions | Schema locked; emitter scaffold |
| `done` | `EventTransactionCompleted` | `complete_transaction` | Schema locked; after `status` |
| `fail` | `EventTransactionFailed` | `fail_transaction` | Schema locked; after `status` |
| `admin` | `EventAdminTransferred` | `transfer_admin` | Schema locked; emitter scaffold |

Guaranteed order on `complete_transaction`: `status` then `done`.  
Guaranteed order on `fail_transaction`: `status` then `fail`.

Semver policy for future schema edits: [`EVENTS.md` § Semver policy](./EVENTS.md#5-semver-policy).

### Added

- On-chain transaction registry scaffold (Phase 1).
- Live emitters: `init`, `reg`, `pause`, `upgrade`.
- Admin-gated `upgrade`, pause circuit breaker, validation and storage helpers.

## Event-schema entry format (for maintainers)

When revising the event API, add a bullet under **Event schema** using this
shape so subscriber teams can scan without reading the full code diff:

```markdown
### Event schema

- **BREAKING (major):** rename topic `reg` → `register` — Phase 2/3 notice: YYYY-MM-DD.
- **Additive (minor):** append field `memo: String` to `EventTransactionRegistered`.
- **Docs (patch):** clarify that idempotent `register_callback` emits no events.
```

Rules of thumb (normative text in [`EVENTS.md`](./EVENTS.md#5-semver-policy)):

- Removal / rename / reorder / type change / emission-order change → **major** + advance notice.
- New trailing field or new event type → **minor** (or patch if docs-only).
